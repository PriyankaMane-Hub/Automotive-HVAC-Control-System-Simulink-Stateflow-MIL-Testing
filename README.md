 # üå¨Ô∏è Automotive HVAC Control System | Simulink + Stateflow + MIL Testing

## üìå Project Overview  
This project involves the development of an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control system for vehicle cabins using a Model-Based Design approach in MATLAB/Simulink. Starting with a clear understanding of system functionality, I created structured system requirements that drove the development of a bus-based Simulink model integrated with Stateflow for logic control. Each requirement was linked to specific test case scenarios, and the system was validated using Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) simulations to ensure functional accuracy under various operational conditions.

HVAC systems play a vital role in enhancing passenger comfort, maintaining driver alertness, and ensuring visibility through effective defogging and climate control. As vehicles become more intelligent and energy-efficient, precise HVAC control is essential for both thermal management and user experience.
